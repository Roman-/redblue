# Making it work with xkb

xkb is painful and buggy. To make Shift+BLUE+a behave the same way as shift+left, the RedirectKey action is used (see the symbols file). But autorepeat doesn't work in this case regardless of whether `autorepeat=yes` is set in xkb files. So I've added the script that sets autorepeat for alphanumeric keys to the Ubuntu startup.
